= The Platform Test Plugin

The Platform Test Gradle plugin manages the lifecycle of a platform to set up systems under test for E2E testing.

[[sec:platform_test_usage]]
== Usage

To use the Platform Test plugin, include the following in your build script:

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("com.felipefzdz.platform-test") version "0.0.13"
}
----

[[sec:platform_test_tasks]]
== Tasks

The plugin intends to augment Gradleâ€™s built-in test task by providing a task called `deployPlatform` that will set up
a Footloose lightweight VM (actually just a docker container), deploy a workload on it and wait for some probe.
To cleanup the container enclosing the platform a task called `cleanupPlatform` will have to be called.

To do that, it uses link:url[Footloose, https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose], a tool that mimics a VM in Docker.

This implies that no dependencies are required on the executing machine, except for Docker itself.

=== Extension

[source,kotlin]
----
platform {
    config = file("/installationDir/config.yaml")
    provision = file("/installationDir/provision.sh")
    probe {
        retries = 2
        delay = 20
        port = 8082
        path = "/missing"
        status = 404
    }
}
----

* config - yaml file to define the Footloose container. Name is irrelevant as it will be mapped to the required `footloose.yaml` See link:url[here, https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose#footlooseyaml]
* provision - bash script to deploy the platform into the container.
* probe - for above's example, the plugin won't give control to the test task until http://localhost:8082/missing would return 404.
It will retry twice, with a 120 seconds delay.
** retries - by default 20
** delay - in seconds. By default 10 seconds.
** port - an ingress controller will be open on this configured port, i.e. localhost:port will be accessible from the host. By default 8081.
** path - where to check that the platform is ready to serve, aka ready to be tested. By default "/". N.b the leading slash is expected
** status - the acceptable status code return by the probe. By default 200

=== Docker Desktop for Mac

When using Docker Desktop for Mac bear in mind that the default memory limit for containers is
2GB so it might be insufficient for your deployments.
